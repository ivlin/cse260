Bound mismatch: The generic method sort(List) of type Collections is not applicable for the arguments (ArrayList). The inferred type Student is not a valid substitute for the bounded parameter > at beginnersbook.com.Details.main(Details.java:11)

Now you must have understood the importance of these interfaces. Let’s see how to use them to get the sorting done in our way.
